# DKE Hack Housing
The DKE Hack Housing is a 3D-printable cradle designed to mount to another drone and hold the following hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 3
* HackRF One
* Alpha Packet Injection-Capable WiFi Dongle
* Varied size Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery

This assembly can be used to execute the DKE ddrone toolkit from another drone, specifically a Tarot kit drone, but can be modified to fit on other drones of similar size. The attached STL file can be used to print this cradle.
